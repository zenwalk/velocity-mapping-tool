#summary Explanation of the VMT ouput file formats
<wiki:toc />
=Output File Formats=

Data files can be exported from VMT that contain the processed data for archiving, use in other programs, and for review.  File formats include Matlab data files ({{{*.mat}}}), Tecplot data files ({{{*.dat}}}), iRIC vector files ({{{*.anv}}}), multibeam XYZ bathymetry files ({{{*_mbxyz.csv}}}), Google Earth files ({{{*.KML}}} and {{{*.KMZ}}}), and GIS compatible ascii files ({{{*_GIS.csv}}}).  Below is a summary of each data file format and a description of the data they contain.

==Matlab data files ({{{*.mat}}}):==
Files contain Matlab data structures with the raw ADCP data, intermediate variables used in computations, and final processed and averaged data.  The data structures are extensive and will not be discussed in detail here. See [DetailedVMTFileStructure] for a complete description.

===Tecplot Data files ({{{*.dat}}}):===
Files contain processed and averaged ADCP data formatted for direct import into Tecplot.  Choosing the Tecplot export option will export the average cross-section data only with no smoothing or data reduction (vector spacing) applied.  Data files contain a header with all necessary information.  One data file ({{{*_TECOUT.dat}}}) contains the velocity and backscatter data array for the cross section while the other data file ({{{*_TECOUT_XSBathy.dat}}}) contains the georeferenced bed depth and bed elevation data.  The data files contain the following variables:

==iRIC Vector Data Files ({{{*.anv}}}):==
The iRIC river modeling interface allows input of vector velocity data for model calibration and validation (2-D) in the form of ANV files.  Currently (VMT v2.4xbeta) will export ANV files from the ASCII2GIS utility (depth-averaged velocity along the curvilinear boat path) and ANV files containing the depth- or layer-averaged velocity as displayed in the plan view plot with vector spacing and smoothing applied.  The format of these data files is as follows:

  The vector files contain x, y, z, vx, and vy values in each line and separated by spaces. Units are MKS.
  x: x position (UTM Easting in m)
  y: y position (UTM Northing in m)
  z: z position - Presently the z- value is unused and can be set to zero.
  vx: the x or easting component of velocity
  vy: the y or northing component of velocity.
  There is no header with the number of points in the file.
  The extension for vector files is .anv

===Multibeam XYZ Bathymetry Files ({{{*_mbxyz.csv}}}):===
These files contain the bathymetry data from the four individual beams of the ADCP, corrected for heading, pitch, and roll using an algorithm provided by TRDI and in use in Dave Muellerâ€™s ADMAP.  The data is formatted as a simple CSV (comma-separated value) file that is easily imported into ArcGIS using the XY data import tool.  The user has the option to add ancillary data to the data file.  A description of the data files with and without the ancillary data is as follows:
*Without Ancillary Data*

   }}}
  
NOTE: UTM coordinates referenced to the WGS84 reference frame if that was set in the GPS unit used during data collection (typical).  

===Google Earth files ({{{*.KML}}} and {{{*.KMZ}}}):===
These files are generated to allow the user to display the transect shiptracks ({{{*.kml}}}) and mean cross sections ({{{*.kmz}}}) in Google Earth.  The KML files are generated using the VMT utility ASCII2KML and the KML files must be loaded into Google Earth for display.  The KMZ files are generated at the request of the user in the VMT interface and will open automatically in Google Earth through a request in the VMT code.  The KMZ files are best viewed as 3-D cross sections so the user should adjust the view in Google Earth to get the best display of the cross section.  In order to display each KMZ file as a 3-D cross section, the user must enter an offset in the VMT interface that is greater than or equal to the max depth in the reach.  This will ensure the cross section is fully displayed above the image plane in Google Earth.  Failure to enter an offset will place the cross section below the plane of the background image in Google Earth, thus blocking the view of the data.

===GIS Compatible ASCII Files ({{{*_GIS.csv}}}):===
These files contain georeferenced depth- or layer-averaged data for every ensemble along the curvilinear shiptrack.  The file also includes ancillary data.  Data is formatted in a CSV file with a header that allows direct import in to ArcGIS using the XY data import tool.  A description of the data contained in the file is as follows:
