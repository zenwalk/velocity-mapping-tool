function A = VMT_unitQcont(A,V,z)
% VMT_UNITQCONT applies unit discharge continuity correction MCS velocities
% This routine computes the correction, then applies it to the North and
% East velocity components of each ensemble and bin for the ADCP data. This
% routine runs BEFORE the data are gridded to the mean cross section, so
% if used, the correction applies to all subsequent computations (e.g., ZSD
% and Rozovskii decomposition).
% 
% DISCUSSION 
% In theory, the change in elevation in the streamwise direction
% should be zero (since we are creating a plane in the lateral direction).
% However, in practice, this may not be the case. Hopefully, the user has
% chosen an appropriate cross section location where the bed is not varying
% dramatically in the streamwise direction, but even still, some error may
% exist. One way to approach this potential error is to account for any
% changes in the mass flux between the sample location where data were
% collected (i.e., the actual ensemble) and the position on the mean cross
% section. This function corrects the mean cross section velocities,
% assuming that mass flux is constant in the streamwise direction.

% 
% There are several reasons to be cautious in choosing to apply this
% correction: 
% 1.It makes the assumption that mass flux is constant in the
%   streamwise direction. This is probably true for well selected
%   cross-sections. But it could break down in cases where flow is strongly
%   convergent or divergent, or if the deviation of the shiptrack is too
%   great. 
% 2.Streamwise flow in situations of changing depths will accel./decell.
%   according to the Bernoulli principle- and this is the reason for the
%   correction. However, because of the beam spread, it is likely that
%   in these situations where streamwise depth is varying, the the depth
%   will be incorrectly estimated, and will lead to high or low biased
%   velocities (depending on whether depth is deepening/shoaling).
% 3.Essentially, this amounts to correction of the data by estimating the
%   depth at the mean cross section. If the coverage of the shiptracks are
%   sparse for a certain region of the mean cross section, the quality of
%   the depth estimation will be significantly affected, leading to a bias
%   in the correction. A situation where shiptracks may not perfectly
%   represent the bed is near the bank, with flow seperation. Here, ship
%   tracks often drift off the best fit line computed by VMT, since the
%   majority of the data are better clustered there. In this case, the
%   correction will become biased by the estimation of the depth at that
%   location.
