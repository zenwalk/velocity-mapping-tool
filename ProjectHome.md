## Overview ##
The Velocity Mapping Toolbox (VMT) is a Matlab-based software for processing and visualizing ADCP data collected along transects in rivers or other bodies of water. VMT allows rapid processing, visualization, and analysis of a range of ADCP datasets and includes utilities to export ADCP data to files compatible with ArcGIS, Tecplot, and Google Earth. The software can be used to explore patterns of three-dimensional fluid motion through several methods for calculation of secondary flows (e.g. Rhoads and Kenworthy, 1998; Lane et al., 2000). The software also includes capabilities for analyzing the acoustic backscatter and bathymetric data from the ADCP. A user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) enhances program functionality and provides ready access to two- and three- dimensional plotting functions, allowing rapid display and interrogation of velocity, backscatter, and bathymetry data.

## Start Using VMT ##
You can download the current standalone compiled versions of VMT and its utilities at:
  * [VMT version 4.05](http://velocity-mapping-tool.googlecode.com/files/VMTv4.05_bin.zip)
  * [ASCII2GISv1br1.exe](http://velocity-mapping-tool.googlecode.com/files/ASCII2GIS_GUI.exe) (This comes packaged with VMT)
  * [ASCII2KMLv1br1.exe](http://velocity-mapping-tool.googlecode.com/files/ASCII2KML_GUI.exe) (This comes packaged with VMT)
The compiled versions of these programs use the [Matlab Compiler Runtime 2012 a 32 bit v7.17](http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html) library.

The VMT source code is also available via anonymous SVN at:
```
# Non-members may check out a read-only working copy anonymously over HTTP.
svn checkout http://velocity-mapping-tool.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ velocity-mapping-tool-read-only
```

Alternatively, source files are available as a zip archive (requires Matlab):
  * [VMTv4.05\_src.zip](http://velocity-mapping-tool.googlecode.com/files/VMTv4.05_src.zip)
